# Restaurant Website

This fully-fledged React restaurant page was developed to improve my **Redux** and **Redux-Thunk** skills.

## Dependencies
- react-redux-form
- redux-logger
- react-animation-components
- react-transition-group
- react-router-dom
- prop-types
- font-awesome

## Installation
I used json-server to create a fake local server, so first you need to install json server.

- `npm install json-server -g`.

After that you can move the [json-server](https://github.com/gunayanil/restaurant-website/tree/master/json-server) file to any location on your computer.

- Then `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all dependecies when you are in the **application directory.**

Before start the application you need to watch the db.json in json-server file.

-  `json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000` when you are in the **json-server directory**.

- Finally move to the application directory and type `yarn start` or `npm start`
## Technologies/Tools
